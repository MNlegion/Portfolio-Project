# Rob Kreuser's Portfolio Project

# This project is my first attempt at creating something from nothing. I have embarked on the jourey into full stack development and therefore decided it best to create a public portfolio in which I can expand upon as my skills progress. 

# This project aims to use all the available and newly learned skills I have studied, which applying them to various concepts throughout the sections of the portfolio. 

# At the moment my portfolio consists of the below concepts:
    # Fundamentals of HTML
    # Fundamentals of CSS
        - flexbox
        - media queries
        - CSS variables

# 3/20/2022 Goal Objective
    # Present developer name, photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact
    # Navigation bar which scrolls to the corresponding section within the portfolio
    # Titled images of my current applications
        - first application appearing larger in size than the rest
    # Images of applications provide clickable links to the deployed application
    # Responsive layout for adaptable viewports
